                 Native XDS-x86 Linux Edition
                 ----------------------------
                            v2.60

                    Fixes And New Features


Version 2.60
------------

       This is a maintenance release fixing some bugs in the
       compiler and the runtime library. 
       
       The XDS setup package includes three products now:
         - Native XDS-x86,
         - XDS-C and
         - TopSpeed Compatibility Pack.


Version 2.51
------------

        This is a maintenance release fixing some bugs in the
        compiler and the runtime library. Also, XDS executables
        (xc and h2d) are now statically linked to
        maintain compatibility with old Linux distributions.


Version 2.50
------------

Compiler:

        Bug-fixes

Library:

        GC speedup and drastic reducing memory consumption

        Adaptive heaplimit (setting HEAPLIMIT to 0 results in
        heuristic choice of heaplimit at run-time)

        GCTHRESHOLD does no longer affect memory management

        Bug-fixes



Version 2.31
------------

New:

        Inline assembler

        POSIX API definition modules

Improved:

        X Window/Motif API definition modules

        H2D


Version 2.21
------------

This is merely a fixed and slightly improved v2.20. The only
major addition is the TopSpeed-like library set (Win32 and OS/2 
editions only).


Version 2.20
------------

This version is the first commercial release which comes with the IDE
(Win32 and OS/2 editions only). The following changes were made since
2.10 release and 2.14 pre-release:

Compiler:

        A number of bugs fixed

        SYM-FILE VERSION CHANGED - RECOMPILATION IS NECESSARY

        Pentium instruction scheduling implemented

        A number of floating-point optimizations introduced

        Integer division by constant is now replaced with multiplication

        xc =m <file> now calls linker if <file> is a Modula-2 program
        module or an Oberon-2 main module (option MAIN is on)

        The SYSTEM.REF procedure was added (the same as ADR, but returns
        typized pointer.

        Compatibility rules for foreign procedures are relaxed further
        (see User's Guide->Multilanluage Programming->Relaxation of
        compatibility rules).

        Much more efficient (but still not ideal) code is generated 
        for aggregate constants.

        Equations and environment variables may be used in redirections:
        *.sym = $(XDSDIR)/sym

        Separate exception source for ASSERT added

        Compiler sets new equations:
                MODULE (name of the current module)
                FILE (name of the current file)

        Compiler exit code is now either 0 (ok) or 1 (error).

        SYSTEM.FILL is added

        <type>(<const>) is now equivalent to SYSTEM.CAST(<type>,<const>)

        BOOLEAN, SYSTEM.BOOL8 and SYSTEM.BOOL32 are much more compatible

        SYSTEM.M2ADR is available from Oberon-2

        CODENAME and DATANAME equations for segment names

        CPU486 is replaced with CPU and MINCPU

        It is now possible to declare/set equations in source text

        ALIGNMENT is an inlineable equation now (1,2, or 4)

        DEF option is renamed to CHANGESYM to avoid conflicts
        
        VAR-parameters can be marked as NIL-compatible
        
        SYSTEM.BOOL16 added
        
        Default sizes of enumeration and small set (<17 elements) types
        can be specified inline via ENUMSIZE and SETSIZE equations
        
        Options and equations syntax unified
        
        Foreign modules (e.g. resource files) are now supported in 
        project files and templates
        
        UNC filenames (\\computer\dir\file) are now accepted.

Linker:

	linker is now able to pass messages to the IDE
	
	COFF object files and libraries are supported (but not properly tested
	yet)

Library:

        Some bugs fixed

	Multithread version of all libraries and implemented

        Added module Printf

        ISO modules LowReal, LowLong are implemented

        ProgEnv.String and ProgEnv.StringLength are implemented
        
        ISO I/O library speeded up significantly
        
        Raw operations are allowed on standard channels

Run-time support:

        Multithread version of run-time support is implemented
        
        History is always written to file now
        
        Oberon-2 finalizers are called on program termination

Win32 IDE:

        Plenty of bugs fixed
        
        Context help added

        Files are opened using redirections and lookups if typed without
        path

        IDE maintains a list of source files which are either specified
        by user or received from the compiler.

        Project file editor:
                user options/equations
                module list
                
        User-defined tools
        
        Window layout and cursor positions are stored for each project

        RegComp.Substitute description is corrected


Version 2.10
------------

This is the first product version of Native XDS. After more
then half a year of extensive testing we are happy to announce this
product.

For the users of XDS v2.06 we list the differences between v2.06
and v2.10. Note: there are no product versions such as v2.07,
v2.08, v2.09. The version v2.07 was used internally and
distributed as beta and demo version.

What is new in v2.10:

        1) Extended syntax of conditional expressions, e.g:

           <* IF defined cc & (cc = Watcom) THEN *>

           See "Configuring XDS" and "Conditional compilation".

        2) Relaxed compatibility rules are introduced for
           parameters of "C" procedures. See "Multilanguage
           programming".

        3) String literal may be used in a direct language
           specification instead of numeric values:
              "Oberon"  = 0
              "Modula"  = 1
              "C"       = 2
              "Pascal"  = 5
              "StdCall" = 7 (Win32 standard calling convention)
              "SysCall" = 8 (OS/2 system calls)

        4) new equations
              COMPILERHEAP   - defines compiler heap limit
              COMPILERTHRES  - defines compiler threshold

        5) New clause in the ERRFMT equation - errno (error
        number).

        6) new option M2UNPACKTYPES - for Windows interface

        7) new ALIGNMENET option

        8) equation declaration syntax is introduced:
           -xxx!value

        9) Make does not use dependency on a project file.


       10) New directives may be used in configuration, redirection
           project and template files:

           !if expr then
           !elsif expr then
           !else
           !end

           !message expr

           expr = simple [ ("=" | "#" | "<" | ">") simple ]
           simple = term { "+" | "OR" term }
           term = factor { "AND" factor }
           factor = "(" expr ")"| quoted_string
                  | "NOT" factor | "DEFINED" ident | ident
           ident = option | equation

       11) In all system files:

            \ at the end of line - line continuation.

            $! - denotes the directory name of this file:
               *.sym = $!/sym;

       12) new template syntax (See "Template files").

                         [end of document]
