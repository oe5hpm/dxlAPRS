(* the string form of a signed fixed-point real number is
   ["+"|"-"]. decimal digit, {decimal digit}, [".", {decimal digit}]
*)

(* the string form of a signed flating-point real number is
   signed fixed-point real number, "E", ["+"|"-"], decimal digit, {decimal digit}

PROCEDURE StrToReal (str: ARRAY OF CHAR; VAR real: float; VAR res: ConvResults);
(* Ignores any leading spaces in str. If the subsequent characters in str are in the
   format of a signed real number, assigns a corresponding value to real.
   Assigns a value indicating the format of str to res.
*)

PROCEDURE RealToFloat (real: float; sigFigs: CARDINAL; VAR str: ARRAY OF CHAR);
(* Converts the value of real to floating-point string form, with sigFigs significant
   figures, and copies the possibly truncated result to str.
*)

PROCEDURE RealToEng (real: float; sigFigs: CARDINAL; VAR str: ARRAY OF CHAR);
(* Converts the value of real to floating-point string form, with sigFigs significant
   digits, and copies the possibly truncated result to str. The number is scaled
   with one to three digits in the whole number part and with an exponent that is
   multiple of three.
*)

PROCEDURE RealToFixed (real: float; place: INTEGER; VAR str: ARRAY OF CHAR);
(* Converts the value of real to fixed-point string form, rounded to the given place
   relative to the decimal poin, and copies the possibly truncated result to str.
*)

PROCEDURE RealToStr (real: float; VAR str: ARRAY OF CHAR);
(* Convers the value of real as RealToFixed if the sign and magnitute can be shown
   within the capacity of str, or otherwise as RealToFloat, and copies the possibly
   truncated result to str. The number of places or significant digits are
   implementation-defined.
