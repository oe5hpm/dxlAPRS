program

     error messages.

PROCEDURE NullChan (): ChanId;
  (* Returns the identity of a channel open to the null device. *)

  (* The following functions return the default channel values *)

PROCEDURE InChan (): ChanId;
  (* Returns the identity of the current default input channel. *)

PROCEDURE OutChan (): ChanId;
  (* Returns the identity of the current default output channel. *)

PROCEDURE ErrChan (): ChanId;
  (* Returns the identity of the current default error message channel. *)

PROCEDURE SetInChan (cid: ChanId);

(* Sets current position of stdout/stderr channels according to the real 
   position in the stdout/stderr channels.
   Returns true on success or false on errors.

   This usage scenario is the following:
   1) one calls Flush on the stdout/stderr objects
   2) executes several processes that may write something to stdout/stderr streams
   3) call to Synchronize ()
